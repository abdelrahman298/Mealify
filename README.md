# Mealify-Website
# Description

Welcome to my project, this is a website of the restaurant called Mealify, ife in HTML and CSS only.
It allows users to check the restaurant's meals, can see professional chefs, their amazing meal images, and finally able to book a table for their next dinner.

The website has the restaurant's location and information
such as :
Address, Emal,phone number and opening hours

# What I have used

- I used only HTML and CSS
- The website is totally responsive and suitable for all types of devices like Desktop, Tablet, and phones
- you can use light and dark modes manually and automatically
- automaticcaly means depends on your devices mode, if your device is in light mode or dark mode the website will respose on your device's mode
- I used many  pseudo-class in css like:
    - :has
    - :checked
    - :hover
    - :focus
    - :target
- also use prefers-color-scheme for website modes.
-and use animation to shake an image ^_^.
- finally used var() in CSS to improve my performance and clean codes.
